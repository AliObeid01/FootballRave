Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses [React Native EXPO](https://expo.dev/) for the Frontend. Expo is a bundle of tools created around React Native to help you start an app very fast.
- This project uses [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) for the Backend. Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Mongoose ODM](https://mongoosejs.com) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com).
